# Interactive System Design Practice
## The goal

  I want to focus on a more interactive JavaScript learning experience with System Design. To supplement reading the Grokking System Design Interview, I want to design the system visually using console commands, tests, and simpler indicators of why **A** **B**, and **C** are implemented and what is it doing.

Here you will find steps for Caching, Load Balancing, and Partitioning will timeout for 4-5 seconds console logs what is happening in the moment and why we have it in place.

Following the interactive design is a comprehensive readme that will break down the pros and cons, the thought process, and the alternatives of each design.

Currently, I'm working with examples from Grokking the System Design Interview but will find more content on Cloud Design Patterns from Azure in the future.

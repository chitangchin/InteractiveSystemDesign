# TinyURL

## Why?

### Problem

Extremely Long links waste alot of space, when displayed and stored it will cost more resources for each additional character over many years.

### Solution

Shorten URLS that will cut down the size significantly.

#### Example:

Long:
[http://thelongestdomainnameintheworldandthensomeandthensomemoreandmore.com/](http://thelongestdomainnameintheworldandthensomeandthensomemoreandmore.com/)

Shortened:
[https://tinyurl.com/bdfzddz8](https://tinyurl.com/bdfzddz8)
